## SIMULATION PROCEDURE:
1. Open the LTspice software.
2. File → New Schematic.
3. Click the Component symbol to browse and select components.
4. Click OK and place the component.
5. Search for resistor from the component menu or tab icons.
6. Place the resistors.
7. Use Ctrl + R to rotate the components.
8. Use the Wire symbol to connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
9. Right-click each component to give the values.
10. Use the Run button to run the simulation.
11. Set the step time and click OK.
12. Output dialog box will open.
13. In the output dialog box, right-click and select Add Traces.
14. Node voltages and current of each component will be displayed.
15. Select the required node voltages (V(n001)) to get the waveforms.
16. To get the voltage across a component, the trace should represent both nodes (example: V(n001,n002)).
